Hybrid of traditional shared-disk and shared-nothing database architectures.
**Shared-disk:** use central data repository for persisted data accessible for all compute nodes in platform
**Shared-nothing**: process queries using massively parallel processing (MPP) compute clusters (each node in cluster stores a portion of the entire data set locally)
⭐️ Simplicity from shared-disk architecture, performance and scale-out benefits from shared-nothing architecture

### Database Storage
- Snowflake reorganises loaded data into internal optimised, compressed, columnar storage
- The optimised data will be stored in cloud storage
- Snowflake manage how data is stores
	- Organisation
	- File size
	- Structure
	- Compression
	- Metadata
	- Statistic

### Query Processing
- Performed in processing layer
- Process queries using virtual warehouses, each is an MPP compute cluster composed of multiple compute nodes allocated by Snowflake from cloud provider
- Each warehouse is a cluster that does not share compute resources with other warehouses
- So each warehouse no impact on other warehouses' performance

### Cloud Services
- Collection of services that coordinate activities across Snowflake
- Tie components to process user requests, from login to query dispatch
- Runs on compute instances provisioned by Snowflakes
- Services
	- Authentication
	- Infrastructure management
	- Metadata management
	- Query parsing and optimisation
	- Access control
