### Optimise SQL Queries

Select only necessary columns (avoid `*`)
```sql
SELECT name, age FROM users;
```

Use proper join types
```sql
SELECT u.name, o.order_date FROM users u
INNER JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
```

Filter early (WHERE as early as possible)
```sql
SELECT name FROM users WHERE age > 21;
```

Avoid N+1 problems (Use JOIN instead of Multiple queries in loop)

Use subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
```sql
WITH UserOrders AS (
	SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as order_count
	FROM orders
	GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT u.name, uo.order_count FROM users u
JOIN UserOrders uo ON u.id = uo.user_id;
```

### Indexing Techniques

B-tree Index - suitable for range queries and exact lookup
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON users(name);
```

Hash Index - exact match queries, faster than B-tree but not suitable for range queries
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_hash_name ON users USING HASH(name);
```

Full-text Index - optimised for searching text within large text fields
```sql
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_ft_text ON articles(content);
```

Composite Index - for queries that filter by multiple columns
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_composite ON orders(user_id, order_date);
```

Unique Index - ensures all values are unique
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_email ON users(email);
```

**Example of optimisation**
From
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = 123 ORDER BY order_date;
```
To
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_order_date ON orders(user_id, order_date);

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = 123 ORDER BY order_date;
```

### Monitoring and Improving Database Performance
- Query execution plans
	- Analyse execution plans to understand how queries are executed and identify bottlenecks
	```sql
	 EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT * FROM users           WHERE age > 21;
	 ```
- Database profiling tools 
	- Monitor performance metrics
	- Identify slow queries (MySQL's slow_query_log)
- Caching
	- Reduce database load for frequently accessed data (Redis, Memcached)
- Connection pooling
- Regular maintenance
	- Vacuuming
	- Defragmentation
- Hardware resources
	- Ensure sufficient resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) for server
