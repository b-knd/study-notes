**Principles**
- [[2.1 Database Normalisation|Normalisation]]
	- Breaking down large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them
- Denormalisation
	- Improve query performance by reintroducing redundancy
	- For read-heavy applications
	- Or application where data retrieval speed is critical

**Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**
Visual representation of data entities and their relationships within database
- Entities - objects or things
- Attributes - properties or characteristics
- Relationship - association between entities
	- one-to-one
	- one-to-many
	- many-to-one
	- many-to-many

**Data Modelling**
- Models structure of database, define how data is organised and accessed
- Types
	- Conceptual
		- high-level overview
		- main concepts and relationship without delving into technical details
		- used during initial planning phase to communicate with stakeholders
	- Logical
		- greater details than conceptual
		- specify attributes and type of relationship
		- servers blueprint for actual physical model without considering storage aspects
	- Physical
		- translation from logical model
		- detailing data storage, indexed and accessed in DBMS
		- includes technical specification and optimisation considerations to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval

**Design Considerations for Efficient Data storage and retrieval**
- Data storage
	- [[2.1 Database Normalisation|Normalisation]] - reduce redundancy and improve consistency
	- [[3. Data Types and Storage|Data types]] - appropriate data types to minimise storage space and ensure data accuracy
- [[4. Query Optimisation and Performance Tuning#Indexing Techniques|Indexes]]
	- Improve query performance
	- Enable quick data retrieval
	- Types
		- Single-column
		- Composite
		- Unique indexes
- Partitioning and Sharding
	- Partitioning - divides large tables into smaller, manageable parts
	- Sharding - distribute data across multiple servers to handle large datasets and increase scalability
- [[4. Query Optimisation and Performance Tuning#Optimise SQL Queries|Optimising queries]]
	- Query designs - write efficient queries to minimise execution time and resource usage
	- Query tuning - use query execution plans and performance monitoring tools to identify and resolve bottlenecks
- [[7. Scaling and High Availability|Scalability]]
	- Vertical scaling - increase server resources (CPU, RAM) to handle growing data volumns
	- Horizontal scaling - distribute data and workload across multiple servers to improve performance and accommodate increasing user demands
