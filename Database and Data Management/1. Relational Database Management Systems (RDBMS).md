**Definition and principles**
Stores data in structured format, using rows and columns to define relationships between entities
Key principles:
- Data structure - organise data into tables (relations), where each table consists of rows (tuples/records) and columns (attributes/fields)
- [[5. Data Integrity and Security|Data integrity]] - through normalisation, reducing redundancy and dependency
- ACID properties - supports **atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability** to maintain data reliability and transactional consistency
> **ACID**
> - Atomicity - ensure each transaction is treated as single unit, either completely successful or completely failed
> - Consistency - ensure each transaction brings database from one valid state to another valid state, maintaining data integrity
> - Isolation - ensure transaction occurs independently without any interference, intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transactions
> - Durability - once transaction is committed, it remains so even in time of system failure

**Key components**
- Tables
	- Basic storage unit
	- Organise data into rows and columns
	- Each table represents an entity and its attributes (object)
- Rows
	- Represent single record or data instance
	- Contains values for each column defined in the schema
- Columns
	- Define specific data elements stored in each row
	- Represent different properties or characteristics of the entity being modelled
- [[5. Data Integrity and Security#Ensuring Data Integrity with Constraints|Keys]]
	- Primary key - unique identifier for each row, ensure record is uniquely identifiable
	- Foreign key - establish relationship between tables by referencing primary key of another table (enforcing referential integrity)
- Indexes
	- Structures used to improve data retrieval speed
	- Created on one or more columns (tuple) of table
