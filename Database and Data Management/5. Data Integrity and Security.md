### Ensuring Data Integrity with Constraints

**Primary Key**
To ensure each record in table is unique and identifiable
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
	id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	name VARCHAR(100), 
	email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

**Foreign keys**
Enforce relationships between tables, maintaining referential integrity
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
	id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	user_id INT,
	order_date DATE,
	FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```
> **Referential Integrity** - that ensures validity and consistency of relationships between tables. It guarantees that relationships between tables remain consistent, specifically that foreign keys correctly and reliably point to existing primary key values in another table.

**Unique constraints**
Ensure all values in column or combination of columns are unique
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
	id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

**Check constraints**
Validate data based on specific conditions
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
	id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	age INT,
	CHECK (age >= 18)
);
```

### Security Best Practices
**Authentication** - verify identity of users accessing the database
- Use strong, unique password for database accounts
- Implement multi-factor authentication where possible

```sql
CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strongpassword';
```

**Authorisation** - control what authenticated users are allowed to do
- Use roles and permissions to manage access
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE on database.* TO 'user'@'localhost';
```

**Encryption** - encrypt sensitive data
- Use technique like Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- Use SSL/TLS for encrypting data in transit
```sql
REQUIRE SSL;
```

**Regular Audits and Monitoring**
- Implement logging and monitoring to track access and changes
- Regularly review logs for suspicious activity

**Least Privilege Principle**
- Grant the minimum required privileges to users and applications

### Compliance with Data Protection Regulations
**General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
- Ensure data subject's rights (access, rectification, deletion)
- Implement data protection measures (pseudonymisation, encryption)
- Maintain records of processing activities
**Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA)**
- Protect electronic protected health information (ePHI)
- Implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards
- Conduct regular risk assessments and audits

### SQL Injection

#### Example of attacks
- Code injection technique that might destroy database
- One of the most common web hacking techniques
- Placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input

**Example**
Putting `105 OR 1=1` in UserId field is equivalent of running a query like below:
```sql
select * from Users where UserId = 105 or 1=1;
```
This will return all rows from Users table, since OR 1=1 is always TRUE

**Example**
Putting `" or ""="` in both User Name and Password field is equivalent to running query like below:
```sql
select * from Users where name="" or ""="" AND Pass="" or ""="";
```
This will also return all rows because ""="" is always true

**Example:** - Batched statements
Putting `105; DROP TABLE Suppliers` is equivalent to running this
```Sql
select * from Users where UserId = 105; 
drop table Suppliers;
```

#### Example of Protection
**Use SQL Parameters**
- Parameters are value added to SQL query at execution time, in controlled manner
- SQL engine checks each parameter to ensure that it is correct for its column and are treated literally, and not as part of the SQL to be executed
In ASP.NET Razor example
```c#
txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId")
txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = @0";
db.Execute(txtSQL, txtUserId);
```
