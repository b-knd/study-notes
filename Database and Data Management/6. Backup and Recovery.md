To ensure data can be restored in case of corruption, hardware failure, or other data loss events. Proper strategy helps maintain data integrity and availability

**Importance of Database Backups**
- Data protection - safeguarding against data loss due to hardware failures, software bugs, human errors or malicious attacks
- Compliance - meeting legal and regulatory requirements for data protection and retention
- Disaster recovery - enabling recovery of data and continuation of operations in the event of a disaster

**Types of Database Backups**
- Full backup
	- Captures complete snapshot of the entire database at a specific point in time
	- **Advantage** - simplifies recovery since only one backup file is needed
	- **Disadvantage** - can be time-consuming and requires significant storage space
```sql
BACKUP DATABASE my_database TO DISK = 'path/to/space';
```
- Incremental backup
	- Captures only the changes made since the last backup
	- **Advantage** - faster and requires less storage space compared to full backups
	- **Disadvantage** - recovery is more complex as it requires the last full backup and all subsequent incremental backups
```bash
mysqldump --incremental --user=root --password --databases my_database > /backups/my_database_incremental.sql
```
- Differential backup
	- Captures all changes made since the last full backup
	- **Advantage** - faster than full backup and simpler to restore than incremental backup
	- **Disadvantage** - requires more storage space than incremental backups but less than full backups
```sql
BACKUP DATABASE my_database TO DIST = 'path/to/space.bak' WITH DIFFERENTIAL
```

**Backup Strategies and Scheduling**
- Regular scheduling - determine frequency of backups based on data criticality and acceptable data loss (Recovery Point Objective - RPO)
	- Example
		- Full - weekly
		- Differential - daily
		- Incremental - hourly
- Offsite storage - store backups in different physical location or use cloud storage to protect against site-specific disasters
- Automated backups - use database tools and scripts to automate backup processes

**Recovery Procedure and Disaster Recovery Planning**
- Testing backups -  to ensure they can be restored correctly
- Recovery procedures - document and practice recovery procedures to ensure quick and effective responses to data loss events
	- Steps
		1. Restore latest full backup
		2. Apply latest differential backup
		3. Apply all incremental backups since the last differential backup
```sql
RESTORE DATABASE my_database FROM DISK = 'storage/full_path.bak';

RESTORE DATABASE my_database FROM DISK = 'storage/diff_path.bak' WITH NORECOVERY

RESTORE DATABASE my_database FROM DISK = 'storage/inc_path.bak' WITH NO RECOVERY
```
