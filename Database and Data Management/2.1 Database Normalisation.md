Organise tables to minimise redundancy and dependency
- Break down table into smaller tables
- Define relationship between smaller tables

### Dependencies

**Functional Dependency**
One attribute uniquely determines another attributes
A -> B
Ex:
EmployeeID -> EmployeeName
EmployeeName is said to be functionally dependant on EmployeeID, given that if we have EmployeeID, we can determine the EmployeeName

**Partial Dependency**
Non-key attribute functionally dependant on part of composite primary key rather than on entire key
Ex:
In a table with columns: **OrderID, ProductID**, OrderDate, Quantity
OrderDate depends on only OrderID which is part of composite primary key (OrderId, ProductID)

**Transitive Dependency**
Non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute which depends on primary key
A -> B
B -> C
Ex:
In a table with columns **StudentID**, AdvisorID, AdvisorName
AdvisorName depends on AdvisorID (non-key) while AdvisorID depends on StudentID

**Multivalued Dependency**
One attribute determines a set of values for another attribute
Ex:

| ProjectID | Skill |
| --------- | ----- |
| 1         | Java  |
| 2         | SQL   |

**Join Dependency**
Table can be decomposed into multiple tables, tables can be joined back to form original table without losing information
Ex:
Table with columns: StudentID, CourseID, Grade
Table can be decomposed into
- StudentID, CourseID
- CourseID, Grade
And can be joined back to get original table

### Normal Forms

#### First Normal Form (1NF)
- Each column contains only one value
- Each row must be unique

Not in 1NF

| StudentID | Name       | Subjects         |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| 1         | John Doe   | Math, Science    |
| 2         | Jane Smith | English, History |

In 1NF

| StudentID | Name       | Subject |
| --------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 1         | John Doe   | Math    |
| 1         | John Doe   | Science |
| 2         | Jane Smith | English |
| 2         | Jane Smith | History |

#### Second Normal Form (2NF)
- Already achieves 1NF
- Remove partial [[2.1 Database Normalisation#Dependencies|dependencies]]
	- Attributes depend on whole primary key

Not in 2NF

| OrderID | ProductID | ProductName | Quantity |
| ------- | --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 1       | 101       | Widget      | 10       |
| 1       | 102       | Gizmo       | 20       |

In 2NF

| OrderID | ProductID | Quantity |
| ------- | --------- | -------- |
| 1       | 101       | 10       |
| 1       | 102       | 20       |

| ProductID | ProductName |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 101       | Widget      |
| 102       | Gizmo       |

Explanation: ProductName depends on ProductID and not entirely on OrderID, so break it into another table with productID as primary key to remove partial dependency in the original table

#### Third Normal Form (3NF)
- In 2NF
- Remove transitive dependencies (non-key attributes not depend on other non-key attributes)

Not in 3NF

| EmployeeID | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| ---------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| 1          | 10           | Sales          |
| 2          | 20           | Marketing      |

In 3NF

| EmployeeID | DepartmentID |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| 1          | 10           |
| 2          | 20           |

| DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| 10           | Sales          |
| 20           | Marketing      |

#### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
- In 3NF
- For every functional dependency X -> Y, X should be a super key

> **Super key**
> Any combination columns that can uniquely identify each row

#### Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
- In BCNF
- No multi-valued dependencies (single attribute should not have multiple independent values)

#### Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
- In 4NF
- Decomposing tables should not introduce any anomalies

> [!NOTE] Anomalies
> Potential problems in database that leads to inconsistencies
> 
> Ex: If table have columns: id, employeeName, departmentID, departmentName. We can't insert new department Finance without inserting dummy employee

### Benefits of Normalisation
- **Data integrity** - data is accurate and consistent across database
- **Eliminates redundancy** - reduce data duplication, which saves storage and minimise risk of anomalies
- **Easier maintenance** - simplifies update, deletion and insertion without affecting overall database integrity
- **Improve query performance** - optimise performance of queries by organising data efficiently

---
### When to Normalise
- When data consistency is critical

> [!NOTE] Data Consistency
> Correctness and uniformity of data within a database or multiple databases

- Data redundancy is high
- Complex data relationship
