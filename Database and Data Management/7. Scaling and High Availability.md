To ensure database can handle increased loads and remain operational during failures. Key to maintaining robust and resilient database system

### Vertical and Horizontal Scaling
**Vertical scaling**
- Involves adding more resources (CPU, memory, storage) to an existing server
- **Advantage** - simpler to implement, no changes to application code
- **Disadvantage** - limited by the maximum capacity of a single machine, potential for single points of failure
- Examples
	- Upgrading server from 16GB to 32GB of RAM
	- Adding more CPU cores to improve processing power

**Horizontal scaling**
- Involves adding more servers to distribute the load
- **Advantage** - better fault tolerance, virtually unlimited scalability
- **Disadvantage** - more complex to implement and manage, may require changes to application architecture
- Examples
	- Adding additional MySQL instances and distributing the load using a load balancer
	- Implementing a sharding strategy to distribute data across multiple servers

###  High Availability Architectures
**Replication**
- Master-slave replication - one master server handles writes, while multiple slave servers handle reads
	- Advantage - offloads read traffic, simple to implement
	- Disadvantage - potential data inconsistency due to replication lag
```sql
--On master server
CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='master_host', MASTER_USER='replication_user', MASTER_PASSWORD='password';

START SLAVE;

--On slave server
START SLAVE;
```
- Master-master replication - multiple server can handle both reads and write
	- Advantage - high availability and load balancing
	- Disadvantage - conflict resolution can be complex, potential for data inconsistency
```sql
-- On both master servers
CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='other_master_host', MASTER_USER='replication_user', MASTER_PASSWORD='password';
START SLAVE;

```

**Clustering**
- MySQL Cluster - distributed database solution providing high availability and scaliability
	- Advantage - no single point of failure, automatic failover, and load balancing
	- Disadvantage - more complex setup and management
	- Examples
		- Configure MySQL NDB Cluster with multiple data nodes and SQL nodes
### Load 
**Load balancing**
- Distributes incoming database requests across multiple servers to balance the load
- Advantage - improves performance, prevents any single server from becoming a bottleneck
- Disadvantage - requires additional components like load balancers
**Failover strategies**
- Automatically switches to a standby server in case of failure
- Advantage - minimise downtime, ensure high availability
- Disadvantage - requires careful setup and testing to ensure smooth failover
