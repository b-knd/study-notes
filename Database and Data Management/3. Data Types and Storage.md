**Common data types and usages**
- INT 
- VARCHAR - variable-length strings
- DATE
- BOOLEAN
- FLOAT

**Storage engines and their characteristics**
- InnoDB
	- Support ACID-compliant transactions
	- Provides foreign key support
	- Row-level locking for better concurrency
- MyISAM
	- Faster read operations
	- Table-level locking
	- Does not support transactions or foreign-keys

**Handling large datasets and optimizing storage**
- Use appropriate data types to save space (Ex: TINYINT instead of INT)
- Normalise data
- Use indexes to speed up query performance
- Partition large tables to improve manageability and performance
- Regularly update statistics and perform maintenance tasks like vacuuming and defragmentation
> **Vacuuming** - clean up and reclaim storage occupied by dead tuples (rows that have been deleted or updated)
> **Defragmentation** - reorganise storage to reduce fragmentation (data not stored contiguously leading to wasted space)
> ```sql
> ALTER INDEX ALL ON TableName REORGANIZE;
>```
