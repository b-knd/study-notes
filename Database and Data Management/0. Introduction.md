**Overview of Databases**
- Organised repositories for storage, management and retrieval of data

**Key aspects**
- **Data organisation** - methods to organise data into tables, rows and columns
- **Data retrieval** - retrieve information/data through queries and transactions
- **Data security** - centralised management allows implementation of robust security measures (Access control and encryption)

**Types of Databases**
1. [[1. Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) | Relational Database]]
	- Organise data into structured tables with predefined relationship between them
	- ACID compliance ensures data integrity (SQL commonly used)
	- Use case: suitable for applications requiring complex queries, transactions, and strict data consistency (ex: banking systems and enterprise applications)
2. NoSQL database
	- Designed to handle unstructured or semi-stuctured data and provide flexible schema models
	- Highly scalable and performance, support distributed data architecture
	- Use case: ideal for big data applications, real time web applications and scenarios demanding high availability and horizontal scaling
3. NewSQL Database
	- Modern relational database designed to address scalability and performance limitations of traditional relational databases
	- Combines ACID transactions with [[7. Scaling and High Availability#Vertical and Horizontal Scaling|horizontal scaling]] capabilities
	- Use case: Applications requiring both relational model's consistency and SQL support, along with distributed database architectures
